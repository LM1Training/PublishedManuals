Employees who are frequently absent, take \u000d\u000aexcessive breaks, arrive late or leave early without advance notice and approval from \u000d\u000atheir managers have not fulfilled an essential function of the job.\u000d\u000aThe Attendance Policy applies to both exempt and non-exempt employees.

It is up to employees \u000d\u000awhether they disclose the specific reason PTO time is needed, unless they desire to \u000d\u000ahave the time off be considered a \u201cplanned\u201d leave under (b) or (c) below.

At a minimum, employees must request \u000d\u000aapproval from their manager for use of time off at least 24 hours in advance. Further, it \u000d\u000ais expected that time off requests of one week or longer must be requested at least two \u000d\u000a(2) weeks in advance.\u000d\u000aUnless you have prior approval, on each day you are tardy or have an unplanned \u000d\u000aabsence, you must communicate your absence to your manager or the designated \u000d\u000aindividual in your business unit within one hour before or after your start time so that \u000d\u000asufficient time is provided to adjust workflow or maintain service levels.\u000d\u000aFailure to notify your manager in a timely fashion may result in disciplinary action up to \u000d\u000aand including termination. Failure to report or call in to work for two consecutive \u000d\u000abusiness days will be considered a voluntary resignation as of the third consecutive day \u000d\u000aof absence.\u000d\u000aMake Up Time:\u000d\u000aNon-exempt employees may be allowed to compensate for the time missed due to an \u000d\u000aabsence (typically an unplanned absence) by requesting make-up time. The approval of \u000d\u000amake-up time is at manager discretion. If make-up time is approved, the make-up time \u000d\u000awill be based on business needs and must be completed in the same pay period as the \u000d\u000atime that was missed. To avoid overtime issues, your manager may require that makeup time be completed in the same pay week as the absence.\u000d\u000aThe amount of make-up time typically must not exceed four (4) hours per pay period. \u000d\u000aBreak time may not be used for make-up time, however, at manager discretion, lunch \u000d\u000aperiods may be used for make-up time if the employee voluntarily agrees to working \u000d\u000aduring the lunch period. If you agree voluntarily to work during one or more lunch \u000d\u000aperiods to make up time, you must communicate to your manager your desire to do so.\u000d\u000aUnapproved Leave of Absence:\u000d\u000aIn the event your request for a continuous leave of absence is not approved and you \u000d\u000ahave missed any time from work related to your leave request, your absence(s) will be \u000d\u000aconsidered unplanned.

Managers should \u000d\u000atalk with the employee to review and consider individual circumstances (such as \u000d\u000ahistorical attendance, current or past performance issues) before taking disciplinary \u000d\u000aactions. When determining if an employee has excessive or chronic absenteeism or \u000d\u000atardies, a manager should consider factors such as the pattern and frequency of \u000d\u000aabsences and tardies and overall performance.\u000d\u000aManagement guidelines for attendance-related absences and disciplinary action will \u000d\u000atypically follow a progression of counseling, including Initial Warning, Elevated Warning, \u000d\u000aFinal Warning, and Termination Consideration. Management reserves the right to \u000d\u000aexercise any disciplinary action considered appropriate, including termination, at any \u000d\u000atime. Attendance history and related disciplinary action may be considered when \u000d\u000amanaging attendance. Prior to warnings may be reinstated or escalated when \u000d\u000aappropriate.\u000d\u000aNew Employees:\u000d\u000aGood attendance habits should begin on the very first day of employment and are \u000d\u000aespecially critical for new employees who have the added responsibility of learning a \u000d\u000anew job. Accordingly, some UnitedHealth Group business units have established \u000d\u000aattendance guidelines for new employees during the first 90 days of employment, when \u000d\u000aattendance is monitored very closely. If employees miss work during this time, the \u000d\u000amanager will apply an appropriate level of disciplinary action.\u000d\u000aReporting Action:\u000d\u000aBoth UnitedHealth Group policy and the Fair Labor Standards Act, a federal law, require \u000d\u000aaccurate recordkeeping of hours worked by non-exempt employees. Falsifying time \u000d\u000arecords may result in immediate employment termination. Managers are responsible for \u000d\u000aensuring that all employees are aware of their exempt / non-exempt status and that \u000d\u000aemployees abide by timekeeping procedures using the Global Self Service Time and \u000d\u000aAttendance application.\u000d\u000aEmployee Guidelines for Attendance:\u000d\u000aWe understand that sometimes you need time away from work.
