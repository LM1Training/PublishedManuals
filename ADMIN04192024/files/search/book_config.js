Employees who are frequently absent, take  excessive breaks, arrive late or leave early without advance notice and approval from  their managers have not fulfilled an essential function of the job.    The Attendance Policy applies to both exempt and non-exempt employees. Employees  with unsatisfactory attendance may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including    termination of employment. Unsatisfactory attendance may also affect unsatisfactory  attendance may also effect an employee’s performance evaluation and opportunities for  promotion, transfer, salary increases, and bonuses.    Planned and Unplanned Absence:    UnitedHealth Group distinguishes between “planned” and “unplanned” absences, as  defined below. Planned absences do not subject an employee to discipline; unplanned  absences may subject an employee to discipline. Availability of an employee’s PTO  balance to cover an unplanned absence is unrelated to whether or not the absence is  subject to discipline.    Whether an absence is planned or unplanned, if employees have Paid Time Off (PTO)  available, then PTO must be used to cover the absence. If no accumulated PTO is  available, employees can choose either to take time off without pay or borrow PTO, with  their manager’s approval. The expectations to mandatory use of PTO would be if the  employee will be allowed to make up the time (see the section on make-up-time) or if  the absence is covered by one of the leave or absence policies that allow employees to  choose whether or not to apply PTO to the absence.                                   Page 4       Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines          Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                Published by LM1 Training    Under UnitedHealth Group’s attendance program, judging why an employee is late or  absent is not the focus when managing attendance. Instead, managers focus on  dependability as the key to overall performance and the effects that unplanned    absences have on individual and department performance. It is up to employees  whether they disclose the specific reason PTO time is needed, unless they desire to  have the time off be considered a “planned” leave under (b) or (c) below. Medical  documentation from the employee is required only if the employee requests SMLA STD,    in which case the formal process for requesting a leave should be followed, and the  manager must instruct the employee to contact Employee Center Help and initiate a  leave of absence.    Planned Absence:    A planned absence is any time away from work that is:        • Pre-scheduled and pre-approved by your manager (see Advance Approval for           Time Off Section below for notification requirements):        • Otherwise approved under UnitedHealth Group’s time off / leave policies-for           example, FMLA leave, Personal Leave, Military Leave, Funeral Leave, jury duty,           court appearances by subpoena, and absences approved do to Short Term           Disability (STD), Long Term Disability (LTD) or Workers Compensation; or        • Other time off mandated by Federal, state or local laws.    Planned absences include pre-scheduled and pre-approved use of granted, borrowed,  or purchased Paid Time Off (PTO). While reasonable efforts will be made to  accommodate requests, managers will make time off decisions based on business  needs and the employee’s performance history.    Managers also have the discretion to approve a planned, unplanned, unpaid absence if  the employee does not have enough PTO to cover the absence and does not want to  borrow PTO.    Employees are expected to give managers as much advance notice as possible, which  will help to accommodate business needs and other employees’ time off requests.    Unplanned Absence:    An unplanned absence, which may subject an employee to discipline, is any time away  from work (or from previously scheduled overtime work) that is not approved as a  planned absence. Unplanned absences will be tracked for each employee over a rolling  twelve (12) month period.    Under the PTO policy for unplanned absences, if PTO time is not available, employees  may:                                   Page 5  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines          Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                Published by LM1 Training        • Borrow up to one standard workweek of PTO, with manager approval, to cover           the absence, or;        • Use the unpaid time to cover the absence. (Employees are not required to           borrow time to cover the absence.)    Regardless of whether the employee has available PTO to cover an unplanned  absence, it does not eliminate the absence from being considered for disciplinary  action.    Advance Approval for Time Off:    Employees are expected to give managers as much advance notice as possible to  assist managers with business planning. At a minimum, employees must request  approval from their manager for use of time off at least 24 hours in advance. Further, it  is expected that time off requests of one week or longer must be requested at least two  (2) weeks in advance.    Unless you have prior approval, on each day you are tardy or have an unplanned  absence, you must communicate your absence to your manager or the designated  individual in your business unit within one hour before or after your start time so that  sufficient time is provided to adjust workflow or maintain service levels.    Failure to notify your manager in a timely fashion may result in disciplinary action up to  and including termination. Failure to report or call in to work for two consecutive  business days will be considered a voluntary resignation as of the third consecutive day  of absence.    Make Up Time:    Non-exempt employees may be allowed to compensate for the time missed due to an  absence (typically an unplanned absence) by requesting make-up time. The approval of  make-up time is at manager discretion. If make-up time is approved, the make-up time  will be based on business needs and must be completed in the same pay period as the  time that was missed. To avoid overtime issues, your manager may require that make-  up time be completed in the same pay week as the absence.  The amount of make-up time typically must not exceed four (4) hours per pay period.  Break time may not be used for make-up time, however, at manager discretion, lunch  periods may be used for make-up time if the employee voluntarily agrees to working  during the lunch period. If you agree voluntarily to work during one or more lunch  periods to make up time, you must communicate to your manager your desire to do so.    Unapproved Leave of Absence:    In the event your request for a continuous leave of absence is not approved and you  have missed any time from work related to your leave request, your absence(s) will be  considered unplanned. For the first month, each week will count as one (1) unplanned                                   Page 6  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines          Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                Published by LM1 Training    absence and each subsequent month will count as one (1) additional unplanned  absence per month.    Administration:    It is the responsibility of managers to provide appropriate corrective counseling and  disciplinary action when an employee’s attendance is unsatisfactory. Managers should  talk with the employee to review and consider individual circumstances (such as  historical attendance, current or past performance issues) before taking disciplinary  actions. When determining if an employee has excessive or chronic absenteeism or  tardies, a manager should consider factors such as the pattern and frequency of  absences and tardies and overall performance.    Management guidelines for attendance-related absences and disciplinary action will  typically follow a progression of counseling, including Initial Warning, Elevated Warning,  Final Warning, and Termination Consideration. Management reserves the right to  exercise any disciplinary action considered appropriate, including termination, at any  time. Attendance history and related disciplinary action may be considered when  managing attendance. Prior to warnings may be reinstated or escalated when  appropriate.    New Employees:    Good attendance habits should begin on the very first day of employment and are  especially critical for new employees who have the added responsibility of learning a  new job. Accordingly, some UnitedHealth Group business units have established  attendance guidelines for new employees during the first 90 days of employment, when  attendance is monitored very closely. If employees miss work during this time, the  manager will apply an appropriate level of disciplinary action.    Reporting Action:    Both UnitedHealth Group policy and the Fair Labor Standards Act, a federal law, require  accurate recordkeeping of hours worked by non-exempt employees. Falsifying time  records may result in immediate employment termination. Managers are responsible for  ensuring that all employees are aware of their exempt / non-exempt status and that  employees abide by timekeeping procedures using the Global Self Service Time and  Attendance application.    Employee Guidelines for Attendance:    We understand that sometimes you need time away from work. UnitedHealth Group’s  Attendance Policy encourages you to plan ahead and pre-approval for the time away.  Unplanned absences can negatively impact you, our members, clients, other  employees, and our business.                                   Page 7  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines          Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                Published by LM1 Training    Common attendance circumstances are described below. Based on the specific  situation, your manager may use some discretion in approving or denying absence  requests.    Employee Responsibilities:    As a UnitedHealth Group employee, you are responsible to:        • Be at work and ready to perform your job each day that you are scheduled.        • Plan your time off and leave it pre-approved by your manager.        • Accurately report your planned and unplanned absences in Global Self Service           Time and Attendance.    Good attendance Habits are a fundamental and required element of everyone’s job  performance and are essential for the efficient business operations and productivity.  Poor attendance negatively affects your co-workers and can harm your job performance  rating.    Definitions:    The following definitions are applied consistently across UnitedHealth Group.    Management Discretion:         The ability of management to look at business needs, as                                 well as an employee’s overall performance and use                                 judgement when approving or denying requests for time off,                                   approving or denying requests for make-up time, and when                                 considering appropriate discipline for violation of the                                 attendance policy.    Planned Absence:               Any time away from work that is pre-scheduled and pre-                                   approved by the manager, or otherwise approved under                                 UnitedHealth Group’s time off / leave policies (e.g., FMLA                                   leave, personal leave, court appearances by subpoena,                                   military leave, funeral leave, jury duty) and absences                                 approved due to Short Term Disability (STD), Long Term                                 Disability (LTD) or worker’s compensation; or mandated by                                 Federal, State, or Local laws.    Unplanned Absence:             Any consecutive period of absence from work that is not pre-                                 scheduled and pre-approved by the manager, or otherwise                                 approved under UnitedHealth Group time off / leave policies;                                 or mandated by Federal, State or Local Laws.                                 An unplanned absence that extends over consecutive days                                 and that is due to single case counts as one unplanned a                                 absence, except in the case of unplanned absences due to                                 an unapproved continuous leave of absence.

Make-Up Time:                                 If each day of the consecutive unplanned absence is due to                                 a different cause, then each day’s unplanned absence will                                 count as a separate unplanned absence. Any absence(s)                                 that are separated by a return-to-work count as a separate                                 unplanned absence(s).                                   Failure to be in the work area and ready to work at a                                 scheduled start time, early departure or late return from                                 lunch or other scheduled non-work time (e.g., breaks,                                 meetings), or leaving the work area or not working through                                 the end of employee’s scheduled work time, without prior                                 approval. Two tardies are generally considered equivalent to                                 one unplanned absence. NOTE: if an employee fails to be in                                 the work area and misses more than 50% of his or her                                 scheduled hours, it is considered an absence as apposed to                                 tardy.                                   Occurs after an employee misses two consecutive days                                 without contacting the manager or other designated contact                                 within the work site and does not contact the manager                                 before the start of the employee’s scheduled work time on                                 the third consecutive work day. On the third consecutive day                                 of absence without notice, the manager may consider                                 termination of employment.                                   Is extra time worked, with prior approval of management,                                 within the same pay period that a non-exempt employee is                                 allowed to work in order to “make up” time they missed                                 (whether planned or unplanned) in order to reach their fully                                 scheduled hours during the pay period. Managers have the                                 discretion, on a case-by-case basis to allow or disallow                                 make-up time.                                   Missed time must be made up in the same pay period and                                 typically cannot exceed four (4) hours per pay period, unless                                 otherwise mandated by Federal, State, or Local laws. Make-                                 up time is generally used for tardies or short absences of up                                 to several hours. Managers will consider business needs,                                 the employee’s overall lperformance, and the potential of                                 having to pay overtime in deciding whether or not to approve                                 make-up time.

Planned Absence:    Employees are expected to give managers as much advance notice as possible to  assist managers with business planning and allow them to better accommodate  requests .While managers will make reasonable efforts to accommodate employee  requests for planned time off, managers have discretion to approve or deny requests  based on business needs and an employee’s performance history.    When employees take a planned absence, they must use available granted, borrowed,  or purchased Paid Time Off (PTO), unless the absence is covered by one of the leave  or absence policies that gives employees the choice. Managers also have discretion to  approve a planned, unpaid absence if the employee does not have enough PTO to  cover the absence and does not want to borrow PTO.    Unplanned Absence:    When employees have an unplanned absence, they must call their manager every day  they are out of work. Employees follow the departmental call-in procedures to report  unplanned absence. Failure to call-in and report the absence may result in disciplinary  action, including termination of employment.    Unplanned absences are unapproved and may subject an employee to discipline,  regardless of whether the employee has PTO to cover the absence. Availability of an  employee’s PTO balance to cover an unplanned absence is unrelated to whether or not  the absence is subject to discipline.    Severe Weather:    In cases of severe weather when the site remains open, employee absence will be  considered as unplanned. Managers have discretion in deciding whether to count the  tardiness on severe weather days as unplanned absence.    Avoiding Excessive Absence:    Managers track employees’ attendance over a rolling 12-month period. Excessive,  chronic, or frequent unplanned absences may subject an employee to discipline based  on company guidelines.

When employees have an unplanned absence, they must report their absence every  day they are out of work. Failure to report absence may result in disciplinary action.  Unplanned absences are unapproved and may be subject to discipline, regardless of  whether the employee has PTO to cover the absence.    An employee who fails to call in and report to work as scheduled for two consecutively  scheduled workdays will be viewed as having abandoned their position. On the third  consecutive day of absence without notice, the manager may consider termination of  employment. The supervisor should consult with Human Resources if this situation  occurs.    Incidents of not following the departmental callout procedures, including No-Call / No-  Show, will be addressed in accordance with the Progressive Discipline policy.    The “Absent” Status:    An employee is deemed absent when he / she is unavailable for work as assigned /  scheduled and such time off was not scheduled / approved in advance as required by  the Workforce Management (WFM) department. To ensure you understand  expectations regarding attendance:        • If you are unable to report to your scheduled shift, please call the Attendance           Line at (716) 427-2237. State your name, supervisor, scheduled shift.        • Advise of call out or late arrival (Military Leave, FMLA, Medical, or etc.).        • In the event you are working and need to leave early please reach out to a           Supervisor, or Team Lead and advise of your early departure. Once notified,           please call the Attendance Line to report early departure.    Tardy:    An employee is deemed to be tardy when he / she;        • Fails to report for work at the assigned / scheduled work time.        • An employee will be given a five (5) minute grace period before the tardiness will           count as an occurrence at the beginning of their shift        • Leaves work prior to the end of assigned / scheduled work time without prior           supervisory approval.        • Takes an extended meal or break period without approval.

A one (1) point occurrence is counted if the employee is tardy or takes an early  departure or if time away from the assigned work location is greater than half their shift    Two (2) episodes or tardiness or early departure may be considered equal to one (1)  unplanned absence    Clocking In & Out for Hourly Employees:    Employees are required to follow established guidelines for recording their actual hours  worked. A missed clock in or out is a violation of this policy and includes:    Failure to clock in and out on their designated time tracker in Global Self Service (GSS)  and Genesys at the beginning and / or end of their assigned shift.    Failure to clock in or out using their designated time tracker for the meal break.  Failure to accurately and promptly report time worked.  Clocking in / out early (or late) of assigned shift without prior approval.    Occurrences:    An occurrence is documented as an absence, tardy or early departure. While an  absence refers to a single failure to be at work, an occurrence may cover consecutive  absent days when an employee is out for the same reason.    Job Abandonment:    No Call No Show occurs after an employee misses two (2) consecutive days without  contacting the Manager, Supervisor, or Attendance Line and does not make contact  before the start of the employee’s scheduled work time on the third (3rd) consecutive  workday. Job abandonment occurs when an employee stops coming to work without  prior notification and fails to respond to attempts made by the organization to contact  them.    Progressive Discipline Process:    Supervisors should monitor their employees' attendance on a regular basis and address  unsatisfactory attendance in a timely and consistent manner. The guidelines for  attendance-related disciplinary action will typically follow a progression of counseling  including am Initial Warning, Elevated Warning, Final Warning, and Termination                                   Page 12  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines            Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                  Published by LM1 Training    Consideration.

The Landmark First  department was created with this commitment of coverage for the markets 365 days a  year. The intent of this guide’s implementation is to ensure this coverage is planned for  and provided in a fair and consistent way among the Landmark First Team.    Policy:    Optum observes eight (8) Holidays. These holidays have been divided into two groups  “Group A” and “Group B” for scheduling purposes, as described below:        Group A Holidays                     Group B Holidays       Christmas Day                         Memorial Day                                               Labor Day     Thanksgiving Day  Day after Thanksgiving                  Independence Day  Martin Luther King Day                   New Year’s Day    All Employees of Landmark First (Full and Part Time) are required to work holidays.  Employees who work more than 30 hours a week will be required to work two (2)  Group A Holidays and two (2) Group B Holidays per holiday cycle in a rotating pattern  as described below. Those employees who work less than 30 hours per week will be  assigned two (2) holidays in advance per holiday cycle.    Landmark First Holiday Cycle runs, Thanksgiving thru Labor Day.    A holiday that falls on the employees regular scheduled day will work their normal  hours for that day. If a holiday falls on a day that the employee does not normally  work, they will be required to work an eight (8) hour shift at managements discretion  to meet the needs of our patients.    An employee may volunteer to cover a greater number of hours than their scheduled  shift.

Swapping Holiday Shifts:    It is acceptable to swap shifts with another colleague with management approval. The  hours of each employee must be covered and worked in full by the swap. For example,  if Employee A is scheduled to work 10 hours and swaps with Employee B, who is  scheduled 8 hours; Employee B, must work Employee A’s 10-hour shift. The employees  swapping is also required to work each other’s scheduled shift. Shift times will not be  altered in any way because of a swap.    Swapping of shifts does not alter the employees holiday rotation, and the swapped  holiday must fall within the same holiday cycle.

Policy:    It is the policy of Landmark First to provide, where deemed appropriate to business  needs, a flexible work arrangement that enables an employee to work at home or in a  satellite location for all, or part, of their workweek.    Landmark First considers telecommuting to be a viable, flexible, work option when such  arrangements can meet both the employee’s and business needs.    Telecommuting may be appropriate for some employees and positions, but not for  others, and is not an entitlement or companywide benefit. The following policy and  procedures provide details on home-based work options. The telecommuting  arrangement does not abridge the “at will” relationship for the employee and Landmark  First.    Definitions Related to Telecommuting:    Telecommuting Employee:  An employee who works remotely in a home office                           or satellite location and does not have a dedicated                           office space within the facility to which they report.    Hoteling Employee:       An employee who works remotely in a home office                           or satellite location and shares a hoteling                             workstation with other employees at Landmark.                           Employees eligible for hoteling must report to the                           office on certain scheduled days, and will not be                           assigned a permanent, personalized, workspace.    Office Based Employee:   An employee whose primary work responsibility                           require they report to a Landmark facility full time.                             Page 29       Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines           Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                 Published by LM1 Training    Telecommuting Eligibility         • The Company must determine that a position can be worked successfully           without the requirement of reporting to a Landmark facility full time.         • The employee must work from a location with reliable, high quality internet           connectivity to access Landmark’s network systems, including the ability to           leverage video conferencing with telephone access. If an employee is in a rural           area where no high-speed Internet connection is available, participation may be           denied.    Manager Responsibilities         • Set clear expectations for both the telecommuting employee and the manager.       • Complete all relevant program documents (attached at the end of this             document).       • Include telecommuting employees within all communications given to in-office             employees.       • Responsible for notifying Human Resources to disconnect all telecommuting             services when necessary.    The Workday and Location         • The full-time telecommuting employee is expected to work during the regular           Landmark operating hours assigned to their role. The employee’s schedule must           be determined in advance and approved by Manager.         • For hoteling employees, the employee and manager must agree on which           scheduled workdays will quality for telecommuting and which days require the           employee report to the office. An employee utilizing hoteling space must follow           the established procedures for booking the required workspace so that they are           ready and available to work at the start of their assigned shift.         • Employees required to punch in and out are still required to do so. Hourly           employees are responsible for ensuring they work only their assigned hours and           do not accrue unauthorized overtime. Performing of any work off the clock is not           permitted.         • Time out of the home for any reason other than scheduled breaks should be           communicated to the Manager before leaving the premises, except in an           emergency. Telecommuting employees must have permission from their           manager before working at any alternate location outside of the home. o There           may be times (i.e., to train new hire employees, attend required meetings, etc.)           when the telecommuting employee will be required to work in the office or travel           to an alternate site on a day/week that they would normally work from home.

If Employee chooses to take this day off, it will be      considered unscheduled PTO.    • In the case of a disaster recovery effort (or other emergency), the employee may      be required to report to work in the office, at management’s discretion.    Onboarding & Training:    Telecommuting employees may be required to report to a designated Landmark  facility for a period identified by the manager at time or hire, or any other time when  required training and development activities will take place.    Example - Location-Based Training Examples:    A newly hired Nurse Care Manager may be required to complete several  weeks of training in a Landmark location before becoming eligible to work  remotely on a full-time basis.    In addition, some states may require time spent in an office location at regular  intervals throughout employment on a monthly or weekly basis.    Inclement Weather:    Under normal circumstances, the telecommuting employee will be required to work  from home even if the office they are affiliated with is closed due to bad weather  unless otherwise agreed upon with Manager.    Other Legal Implications    It is the telecommuting employee’s responsibility to determine any income tax  implications of maintaining a home office. The company will not provide tax  guidance, nor will the company assume any additional tax liabilities. The Employee  is encouraged to consult with a qualified tax professional to discuss income tax  implications.         • It is the telecommuting employee’s responsibility to make sure that they are in           complete compliance with all contractual obligations such as those contained in           leases and/or local township codes, rules, regulations, and zoning ordinances,           which could affect the ability to work at home. The telecommuting employee will           also be responsible to comply with all local residential rules and regulations while           they participate in the home-based work arrangement.                                   Page 31  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines           Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                 Published by LM1 Training    Security & Proprietary Information:    Information protection and security is the responsibility of all Landmark First  employees regardless of work location. Telecommuting employees will be expected  to ensure the protection of proprietary company and customer information accessible  from their home office. Please review the Corporate Compliance Policy and  Procedures.    Provisioning Requirements:    There are specific home office requirements for telecommuting employees, regardless  of full-time or parttime status.    Home Office        • Employees who wish to participate in this telecommuting option must have a           designated in-home workspace space free from distractions and private enough           to comply with HIPAA regulations. A change in the permanent work location           requires notification to the manager. Employee will not be permitted to           participate unless an acceptable in-home workspace is available.        • The telecommuting employee must use an Optum–owned computer, configured           to IT standards, and is responsible for establishing broadband connectivity for           their home office.        • VPN and Secure ID / Citrix access must be obtained through IT.        • The computer must be brought to a Landmark / Optum facility for any required           troubleshooting or technical issues. Third party repairs are not permitted.        • HIPAA regulations may require the Employee to use a dedicated telephone and           dedicated company issued printer to conduct business. This is required for any           telephone and / or printer that will receive or store PHI and could potentially be           accessed by someone other than the Employee.        • Telephones are provided at the discretion of the business functional unit           management. If the job warrants the purchase of a phone, Optum will provide           this for business use only. Employee agrees to exclusively use the telephone           provided by Optum and recognizes that using a personal cell phone or cordless           phone is not acceptable as per HIPAA regulations.        • Employees with roles requiring recorded lines must adhere to processes and           procedures to ensure lines are recorded in accordance with business           requirements.        • It is not permissible to invite third parties to visit the telecommuting employee’s           home office to conduct company business.        • Management reserves the right to visit, unannounced, the telecommuting           employee’s home office at any time during the employee’s regularly scheduled                                   Page 32  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines              Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                    Published by LM1 Training        work hours on any regularly scheduled workday. These visits should be      approved by Human Resources in advance.    • Landmark First / Optum will not be responsible for costs associated with the      initial setup and ongoing expenses of the employee’s in-home workspace such      as remodeling, furniture, or lighting, nor repairs or modifications to that home      office space.    • Telecommuting employees must use headphones or other mechanisms to      safeguard conversations when another individual may be within the residence to      safeguard confidential and proprietary information.    • Telecommuting employees are responsible for setting up and maintaining an      ergonomically correct workstation designated solely for business purposes.    Dependent Arrangements        • The telecommuting program is not designed to be a replacement for appropriate           child and / or adult care.        • Although an individual Employee’s schedule may be modified, with Management           approval to accommodate child / adult care needs, the focus of this arrangement           must remain on job performance and meeting business demands.        • Employee will not be permitted to participate if there will be children or           dependent adults at home who require supervision unless another adult is           present in the household to provide that supervision. If another adult is present           to provide supervision for a dependent child or adult, the Employee must have a           workspace private enough to conduct business without interruption. Phone calls           are to be conducted as they would be in the office environment. Ambient           background noise must be professional and kept to a minimum.             Such noises not only disrupt the office environment that telecommuting must           preservice, but also may affect crucial patient communications where sensitive /           protected information must be communicated clearly.    Example - Unprofessional Background Noise    • Loud Music                            • Television in the background    • Children Crying                       • Conversations of friends / family  • Dogs Barking                          • Text Message Tones                                   Page 33  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines           Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                 Published by LM1 Training    Workers’ Compensation    Landmark First's Workers’ Compensation policy coverage will be available to  employees, but only:        • If an employee suffers a work-related injury; and the injury occurs while the           employee is working in the designated in-home workspace.        • Employee is required to identify the specific area of the home that will constitute           the in-home workspace and the scheduled hours that area will be used as the in-           home workspace. Workers Compensation claims shall not be made for any           illness or injury that is not the direct result of performing Landmark First work           duties in the home workspace.        • Employee agrees that an area will be considered an in-home workspace only for           that Employee and only when that area is being used for Landmark First work           and will make no claim against Landmark First for any injuries suffered by any           other person or party in the in-home workspace.        • Workers’ Compensation will cover the Employee only within the in-home           workspace and only when Employee is performing a work function. Employee           agrees they are solely liable for injuries to third persons and / or members of           Employee’s family on Employee’s premises including the in-home workspace at           all times and will make no claim against Landmark First for the same.        • Employee agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Landmark First, its           affiliates, employees, contractors, and agents from and against any and all           claims, demands, or liability (including any related losses, costs, expenses and           attorneys’ fees) resulting from or arising in connection with any injury to persons           (including death) or damage to property, caused directly or indirectly, by the           services provided by Employee or by Employee’s willful misconduct or negligent           acts or omissions in the performance of Employee’s duties and obligations while           working in an Employee assignment.

Those guidelines do not supersede this policy but aim to  provide specific expectations for participation in a telecommuting program. Those  guidelines should be reviewed by Human Resources in advance of publication.    Suspension or Termination of Employee Arrangement         • The telecommuting program may be discontinued at any time at the sole           discretion of Landmark First / Optum.         • Employee may decide that the Employee assignment is not suitable for them.                       o If Employee returns to prior or designated Landmark Health office                     location, this will happen as soon as possible, but generally not longer                     than 15 days from when the decision is made by Employee or Manager /                     Supervisor that the arrangement is not satisfactory.         • If work performance or attendance suffers and / or Supervisor decides that it will           be in the company’s interest for Employee to return to former or designated           office, Employee agrees to do so with appropriate notice of not less than one           week.         • If Employee decides not to return to an office as directed by management, they           will be considered as having resigned from their position at Landmark First.    Landmark First is committed to helping employees realize their full potential. No policy  can be so specific as to spell out every possible scenario we might face. Instead, we  rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold the highest standard of integrity for  ourselves and our company. We expect all employees to be guided by both the letter  and the spirit of this policy. Non-Compliance with this policy may result in corrective  action up to and including employment termination                                   Page 35  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines  Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024        Published by LM1 Training    Remote Work Policy    The following applies to employees in the United States.

As a UnitedHealth Group Employee, you are expected to meet or exceed performance  goals and follow corporate policies. If, during the course of our career with the company,    you do not meet performance goals or follow company policy, the Corrective Action  Process may be used by your manager to help you understand and correct your  performance and / or behavior.    Applies To:  This policy applies to you if you are:        • Exempt      • Full-Time      • Non-Exempt      • Part-Time    Overview:    The Corrective Action Process is designed to facilitate communication between you and  your manager. It provides your manager with a format to prepare for, document, and  track conversations with you regarding improvements you need to make to meet  expectations. In addition, the process provides you with written guidance expectations  about a performance or conduct issue.    Your Manager can open and close correction actions at one of three levels:        • Initial Warning        • Elevated Warning        • Final Warning    Note that the various warning levels are note necessarily progressive; the company  reserves the right to take any disciplinary action it considers appropriate. In certain  cases, it may be appropriate or necessary to initiate a corrective action at a higher  warning level or to skip levels, depending on the nature or severity of the conduct or  performance issue.                                            Page 42  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines           Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                 Published by LM1 Training    Reservation of Rights:    UnitedHealth Group is an “employer at will.” This means that UnitedHealth Group  reserves the right to terminate you at any time for any reason with or without prior notice  to UnitedHealth Group. If your manager determines that disciplinary action is necessary,  that disciplinary action may include initial, elevated, and final warnings, or termination.    Where To Find the Corrective Action Process Online Tool:    If you receive an email notifying you of a corrective action plan, you may view any  Corrective Actions at any time by visiting Global Self Service (GSS). Corrective Action  information may be found under the MAP > View Corrective Actions option.    Your Role in the Corrective Action Process:    As an employee there may never be an occasion for you to be engaged in the  Corrective Action Process. However, there may be a time when your manager identifies  a situation that calls for a Corrective Action Plan. If this happens, your manager will  inform you of what the company expects of you, define how you are not meeting those  expectations, and provide you with a plan that you must follow to return your  performance or conduct to expected levels.    If your manager opens a Corrective Action Plan for you, your manager will notify you,  and you will receive an automatic email that your manager has submitted a Corrective  Action Plan.    The email notification will also provide you with instructions on how to view the  Corrective Action Plan in Global Self Service (GSS) and enter comments on the plan if  you wish. The system allows you to save your comments in draft form so that you can  work on them over time. Once submitted, your comments cannot be deleted or edited,  so you should write your comments carefully.    If you disagree with the corrective action, go to the Internal Dispute Resolution Policy  and follow the instructions. Action must be completed within 10 days of receiving a  corrective action plan.    Generally, Corrective Action Plans will include target dates by which you must meet the  performance and / or conduct goals your manager has defined for you. If you correct  your performance and / or behavior as required, your manager will close the plan. Even  after a Corrective Action Plan has been closed, you are expected to continue to meet or  exceed performance and conduct expectations; failure to do so may result in further  corrective action up to and including termination of employment.    Levels of Corrective Action:    The Corrective Action Process allows managers to formally prepare for performance  related communications, document performance and expectations, document  discussions with the employees regarding conduct and performance issues and track  employee’s progress on improving performance to expected levels.

There are three levels of warnings  available in the Corrective Action Process Online Tool:    PTO Request Submission Timeframes    Initial Warning   A warning generally used for a first offense or less serious                    violation of policy or failure to meet performance expectations.    Elevated Warning  A warning generally used when an employee has:                          • Committed a more serious policy violation.                          • Significantly failed to meet performance expectations.                          • Exhibited multiple conduct and / or performance issues                             that need to be addressed simultaneously.                          • Shown continued failure to correct performance or                             conduct.    Final Warning     A warning generally used for the most serious of violations of                    company policy or performance issues were employee’s                      termination may result if improvement or correction is not                      immediately demonstrated.    Managers should consider the following factors when determining the appropriate  warning level in the Corrective Action Plan:        • Severity of the misconduct or poor performance and its potential impact on the           company or co-workers.        • The employee’s performance and conduct history, including past or current           warnings.        • Applicable policies, such as the Attendance Policy, which contain guidelines for           warning levels.    A Corrective Action Plan will include the date(s) by which the employee must meet the  performance and / or conduct goals outlined by the manager. If the employee meets the  stated expectations by the defined date(s), the plan will be closed. Following the closure  of a plan, the employee is expected to continue to meet or exceed the expectations laid  out in the plan. Failure to do so may result in further corrective action.

See  below for a complete list of problem-solving options and resources available.    Overview:    UnitedHealth Group values each employee and looks forward to good relations with,  and among, all employees and between employees and management. However, even  in the best of relationships, misunderstandings and concerns may sometimes occur.  UnitedHealth Group believes that workplace concerns are best resolved through open  and candid discussions between employees or between employees and managers, and  employees are encouraged to discuss any concerns as soon as they arise.    In the event that an employee cannot resolve his or her issue informally, UnitedHealth  Group's Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) and Arbitration policy provides the opportunity  to receive a prompt and objective review. These problem-solving processes enable  efficient resolution of employment issues without fear of reprisal and without lengthy  delays. An employee can initiate the IDR process by contacting Employee Center.    This process cannot be used to dispute the following:        • Company policies        • A Performance Review rating of \"Meets Expectations\" or better        • Administrative terminations    Applies To:    This policy applies to all United States-based employees of UnitedHealth Group, except  those who are covered under a Collective Bargaining Agreement that outlines a  separate process for addressing concerns.    Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) And Performance Review Rating Of “Needs  Improvement”    Prior to submitting the Internal Dispute Resolution Appeal Form, the employee must first  submit comments in Global Self Service (GSS) in response to the CAP or common  review \"Needs Improvement\" rating. The employee must do this within 10 calendar days  of receiving the CAP or \"Needs Improvement\" rating. Once comments are submitted,  the employee should schedule a meeting with his or her immediate manager to review  and discuss the additional information. This meeting should typically take place within  10 calendar days of adding the comments to Global Self Service (GSS).                                   Page 45  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines           Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                 Published by LM1 Training    If then there is no resolution after conversation(s) between the employee and manager,  the Internal Dispute Resolution Appeal Form should be submitted in writing to  Employee Center Employee Relations within 10 calendar days from the date the  conversation took place between the employee and his or her manager.    Note: An IDR cannot be filed if an employee receives a Performance Review Rating of  \"Meets Expectations\" or better.    Terminations:    In the case of employment termination, the former employee should submit the Internal  Dispute Resolution Appeal Form to Employee Center Employee Relations within 20  calendar days from the employee's last date of employment. The form should address  why the employee disagrees with his or her termination with a proposed resolution and  include any facts or documentation necessary to support his or her position.    Note: An IDR cannot be filed in the case of an administrative termination.    Other Workplace-Related Concerns    Prior to submitting the Internal Dispute Resolution Appeal Form, generally the employee  should schedule a meeting with the employee's immediate manager to review and  discuss the employee's disagreement with the decision/action that raised his or her  concern. This meeting should typically take place within 10 calendar days of the action  taking place.    If then there is no resolution after conversation(s) between the employee and manager,  the Internal Dispute Resolution Appeal Form should be submitted in writing to  Employee Center Employee Relations within 10 calendar days from the date the  conversation took place between the employee and his or her manager.    Internal Dispute Resolution Meeting and Response Process:    Within 20 days from receipt of the Internal Dispute Resolution Appeal Form, a meeting  or teleconference (if the employee and manager are in different locations) will be  scheduled.    After the hearing, the responsible member of management will complete the appropriate  investigation into the concerns and then will respond in writing, usually within 30 days of  the meeting.    IDR responses are considered to be final and binding on both parties, except that an  employee may request arbitration in accordance with the UnitedHealth Group  Employment Arbitration Policy for those issues subject to the policy.                                   Page 46  Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines              Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                    Published by LM1 Training    Arbitration:    UnitedHealth Group believes that resolution of disagreements is best accomplished by  using the Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) process and, where that fails and a legal  claim exists, through arbitration based on the rules of the American Arbitration  Association.    Employees and UnitedHealth Group benefit from the use of private arbitration because  it usually results in quicker, less costly resolution of disagreements than litigation. For  the benefit of all parties involved, UnitedHealth Group requires all employees to agree  to submit most employment-related legal claims to arbitration as a condition of  employment.    The UnitedHealth Group Employment Arbitration Policy is a binding contract between  each employee and UnitedHealth Group. Arbitration is the exclusive forum for the  resolution of all employment-related legal disputes, including termination of  employment, except those claims specifically excluded under the terms of the Policy.  Arbitration decisions are final and binding upon both the employee and UnitedHealth  Group. Employees are strongly encouraged to use the IDR process prior to requesting  arbitration.    Any party to the dispute may initiate the arbitration process. A separate claims appeal  process applies to certain benefit-related claims. Further information about benefit  claims appeals can be found under the specific benefit within the Benefits Handbook on  the Additional Plan Information page on the Benefits Site (e.g., medical, vision,  dental, 401(k), etc.).    Employees who request arbitration for an employment related legal dispute must submit  a completed Demand for Arbitration.    Employees should include any documentation that supports their claim and copies of all  prior IDR filings and responses. A $25 check or money order payable to \"UnitedHealth  Group Incorporated\" must accompany this form.

The arbitrator follows the rules of law of the state that is the employee's principal  place of work (or the law of Minnesota, if UnitedHealth Group is the complainant), any    applicable Federal law, and the rules as stated in the policy. The arbitrator has the  authority to grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and is                                   Page 47     Landmark First Reference Documents","Company Policies & Guidelines           Proprietary & Confidential    Last Updated: 4/19/2024                 Published by LM1 Training    authorized by and consistent with the applicable law, including applicable statutory  limitations on damages.    The arbitrator does not have the authority to award damages or penalties to any entity  or individual who is not a party to the arbitration. If authorized by and consistent with  applicable law, the arbitrator will have the authority to award attorneys' fees to the  prevailing party if the arbitrator finds that the claim or defense was frivolous, without  merit or was not submitted in good faith.

Use Your Company Email:        You should always use your company email address when sending messages on      behalf of the organization. This should be the only email address that you access      from your company-issued computer.    3.

Be Very Cautious with Humor:    Something perceived as funny when spoken may come across very differently when  written.    “When in doubt, leave it out.\"    8. Your Emails Should Be “cross-cultural”:      Know that people from different cultures speak and write      differently. Miscommunication can easily occur because      of cultural differences.    9. Reply to All of Your Emails:      It's difficult to reply to every email message sent to you, but you should try to. This      includes emails that are accidentally sent to you, especially if the sender is expecting      a reply.

Proofread Every Message    Don't rely on spell-checkers. Read and re-read your email a few times, preferably  aloud, before sending it off.    11. Double-Check That You Have Selected the Correct Recipient        Pay careful attention when typing a name from your address book on the emails      \"To\" line; it's easy to select the wrong name by mistake.    12. Keep Your Font & Color Classic      For business correspondence, keep your fonts, colors, and sizes classic. Your      emails should be easy for other people to read.           Accepted Font Format         Font – Calibri, Times New Roman, Ariel         Size – 10 pt or 12 pt    13.

Instant Messaging        Sending a colleague an instant message over MS Teams is like knocking on the      door of your contact’s virtual office.    2. Be Informal Without Being Inappropriate        Chats between co-workers are designed for quick and informal communication;      however, it is not so informal as to mimic texting. Please avoid using excessive      abbreviations, .Gif images, and emote reactions. While these expressions do have      their place in chat conversations, overuse will impair communications.    3. Ending a Chat        Both you and your co-workers handle several communications at a time and are      often required to multitask between managing their chats and fulfilling their roles and      responsibilities with Landmark. To better manage your communications, end a chat      conversation by thanking our colleague for the time or help.    Attention – Digital Permanence    The chats in which you participate can be screen-captured,  emailed, or otherwise distributed to others throughout the  company. Removing yourself from a chat does not remove the  messages you posted. Please conduct these communications  with courtesy and respect.

Are You Dressed for It?      Be sure you are dressed appropriately and well-groomed.    2. Is Your Workstation Prepared?        It is important that you prepare your workstation before video conferencing. This      includes removing any confidential files that could be displayed to other participants.      Ensure that your background or backdrop is suitable for a business presentation.    3. Are You Alone?        You must arrange accommodations for your dependents while you are at work. This      includes children, animals, and any elderly persons under your care.    4. Conditional Muting        A video conference will pull audio from all active microphone sources unless muted.      This can create disorienting audio feedback for participants. To avoid this issue,      please mute yourself if you are not actively speaking during the meeting.    5. Unscheduled Departures        If, for any reason, you need to take an unplanned departure from a meeting, please      do not interrupt the current host or speaker to announce your exit. Instead, please      post a message in the corresponding chat, disable your camera, mute your      microphone, and reverse these steps upon your return.

Adjust Your Microphone         • Before answering a call, please adjust your microphone so that the caller can            hear you clearly. Some programs have noise canceling features that will mute            your microphone if it is too far from your mouth.         • If you need to adjust your microphone during a call, please mute yourself as the            noises created by a microphone in motion will create crackles and pops in the            audio.    2. Speak With an Even Pace         • Remember that you are using the bandwidth of your Internet connection as well            as the caller’s cellular signal to communicate. There can be interruptions or lag            in audio. Therefore, please included courteous pauses throughout your dialogue            to allow callers the opportunity to respond.    3. Do NOT Use Profanity or Derogatory Language During Calls         • Please treat our patients, co-workers, and guests with respect and empathy.            Using profanity or derogatory language during a call could result in a filed ACES            complaint or Auto-Failed call audit.    4. Verbally Complete Your Calls         • When ending a call, use additional courtesy phrases:             o “Thank you for calling Landmark First”             o “Before I end this call, is there anything else I can help you with?”    5.

Many people with multiple chronic health conditions rely  on hospital emergency rooms as their primary source of  health care. For our families, loved ones and communities,  that simply isn’t good enough.    Landmark approaches care using the patient’s personal  health characteristics, not historical utilization. We respond  to patients 24/7. Our medical care is in addition to patients’ regular primary care  providers and other specialists. Landmark’s team works with the primary care provider.  We provide care to the whole patient with proven outcomes.    We always do what’s right, even when it’s not easy. Employees who thrive at Landmark  believe in our purpose to change health care for complex, chronic patients. We carry the  mantra given by our founders that we always do what’s right, even when it’s not easy.  Changing the status quo takes hard, dedicated work. But doing that work for the greater  good motivates us and moves us forward.    About Landmark First                                 Landmark First provides 24/7 remote call coverage and clinical                               assistance to patients of Landmark Health as a first point of                               contact and resolution.                                 When a Landmark Health market (location) office experiences call                               overflow, those calls are routed to Landmark First to handle                               remotely. Landmark First will then work in collaboration with                               Landmark Health to deliver patient communications, encounter                               information, appointment adjustments, and updated plans of care.    Vision:    Landmark will transform health care by dramatically improving the quality of life in our  communities.

Once received, the PCC will handle the call according to the Transfer Flows described  throughout this section.    Alternative Call Routing:    If no PCCs are available to take the call, the patient will be given the chance to request  a callback. The callback will be sent to the next available PCC.    Support Teams:             • LM1 Full APP & PCC is used to communicate with the administrative and               clinical teams all at once.

Minimize feelings.    Maintain active listening.   Downplay seriousness.    Respond with empathy.        Make empty promises.  Keep your voice calm.        Say “It’s going to be OK”.    Express support & concern.   Force a cheerful voice.    Ask how you can help.        Get into philosophical debates.    Be patient.                  Share a personal story as a form of empathy.

Patients and their caregivers can confirm appointments with Landmark.    Covid-19 Screening Questions:    Patients must clear a Covid-19 screening prior to appointment confirmation. Please ask  the following questions to complete the Covid-19 screening.             1. Do you or anyone in your home have fever/chills, cough/sore throat,               shortness of breath beyond what is typical, or new loss of taste or smell?             2. Have you or any other persons in the home been diagnosed with COVID-19               in the last 30 days?    If a patient successfully clears the Covid-19 screening, please proceed with the  appointment confirmation. Please also provide the patient or caregiver with the  appointment’s Start Time window.    When to Confirm Appointments:    Appointments should only be verified if the verification call  is made within ONE WEEK of the scheduled appointment date.     Attention – Return Calls for Appointment Confirmations     Sometimes, a patient or caregiver will report having missed a call from Landmark.        • Check recent notes in Ubiquity to determine if an Appointment Confirmation            was attempted by a Care Team member.                 • If so, please complete the Covid-19 screening and Appointment                     Confirmation steps.    Rescheduling Appointments:  If a caller needs to reschedule an appointment, no  Appointment Verification is necessary at that time and the  Covid-19 questions DO NOT need to be asked.

It is important that our patients receive regular care and maintenance visits in order to  maintain their quality of life and health.                 • For this reason, ALWAYS ask the patient if they want to reschedule an                    appointment if a cancelation is requested.                 • Please strongly suggest, BUT DO NOT FORCE the issue when the                    patient does not want to reschedule.                 • If you are not able to reschedule during the call, the Care Team will                    conduct a follow-up at a later time.

As our company continues to grow, we should expect to receive more calls similar to  those described above. The Landmark’s Outreach team is responsible for acclimating  new patients to our services; HOWEVER, you are encouraged to provide the following  information when a caller asks about us for the first time:        • Landmark provides home health care solutions for patients with multiple ongoing           chronic conditions.        • Prospective patients should check their eligibility for Landmark services by           contacting their health plan.                 o A health plan phone number can usually be found on the back of the                    prospective patient’s insurance card.        • If the prospective patient qualifies for service, their health plan will contact           Landmark’s Outreach Team.                 o The Central Outreach Team will then attempt to set up an Initial Visit at                    the patient’s home.        • While the prospective patient contacts their health plan, an email will be sent           from Landmark First to the Local Outreach Team to advise them of the request.        • Prospective patients should be on the lookout for phone calls from Landmark or           Optum Home Health as follow-up.        • If we are unable to provide services, we may be able to refer the patient to           community resources in their area.

What is an Initial Visit (IV)?  During the initial visit, the patient will meet with a Landmark Provider to discuss:        1. What services Landmark provides.      2. Our 24/7 coverage is explained in more detail.      3. The patient’s health goals and conditions are reviewed.      4. Authorized contacts and consents are approved.      5.
